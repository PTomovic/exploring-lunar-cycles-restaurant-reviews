Key Features:
Statistical Analysis: Includes basic statistics, ANOVA, Levene’s test, and Welch’s ANOVA to explore correlations.
Data Visualization: Histograms and ridgeline plots provide visual representation of review patterns.
Tools Used: R Studio, BigQuery, and several libraries such as tidyverse, ggridges, and car for the analysis.
Files Included:
Restaurant Reviews & Moon Phases.Rmd: The full analysis including code and explanations.
Data Sources:
Yelp Reviews Data from Kaggle
Moon Phase Data from US Naval Observatory
How to Run:
Clone the repository.
